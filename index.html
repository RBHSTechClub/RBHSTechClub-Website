      <p>Our vision is to reuse as much as possible, refurbish what is usable and recycle the rest. This means that we have the most effective utilization of a technologies lifecycle. Finding that spot isn't simple though, so we do our best to make a judgement call to find the perfect age where we can effectively reuse it for our ideal consumer.</p>
